Exercise 5
7.5 Add and Commit Changes
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to your local Git repository.
Check the status of your files with git status.
Stage all changes for commit with git add . (The dot means all files; you can also add specific files).
Commit the changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "Your commit message". Replace "Your commit message" with something descriptive about the changes you made.
7.6 Create a Git Tag
Create a tag named “Lab2_v1.1” using git tag Lab2_v1.1.
7.7 Push Changes to GitHub
Push the committed changes to GitHub with git push origin main (or master, depending on your default branch name).
Push the tag to GitHub using git push origin Lab2_v1.1.
7.8 Create a GitHub Release

(CREATE A NEW GITHUB RELEASE "LAB2_v1.1" based on the corresponding Git tag.
Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser.
Navigate to the “Releases” section found under the repository name.
Click “Draft a new release”.
Choose the tag you just pushed, in this case, “Lab2_v1.1”.
Fill in the release title and description as needed.
Publish the release by clicking “Publish release”.

Additional Exercise 6
8.1 Implement the calc_median_temperature() Function
Write the function calc_median_temperature() in your code. This function should:
Take a list of numbers (temperatures).
Sort the list in ascending order.
Find and return the median temperature.
8.2 Push Changes to GitHub
Follow the same steps as 7.5 and 7.7 to add, commit, and push these new changes.

8.3 Create a New GitHub Release
Tag the new commit using git tag Lab2_v1.2.
Push the tag using git push origin Lab2_v1.2.
Follow the same steps as 7.8 to create a new release named “Lab2_v1.2” on GitHub.
Remember to test your code thoroughly before committing and pushing, especially for the calc_median_temperature() function to ensure it works correctly.
